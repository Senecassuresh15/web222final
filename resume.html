            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p id="aboutmetxt">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

        <h1>My WEB 222 Experience</h1><br>
        <p>I had a great time taking Seneca's WEB222 course. I learned many things 
            I did not know previously, including how web pages were structured, 
            how they were styled, how to implement certain functionalities and 
            considerations that web developers take when designing them. I enjoyed 
            learning about and 
            practicing programming the small front end event handler 
            programs in the last assignment, 
            as well as creating web pages that linked to each other 
            in the third assignment.
            <br>However, I struggled with the CSS portion of the class, which 
            overwhelmed me with all the style options and considerations I had 
            to take to get the structure I wanted for my web pages. I think it 
            was partially due to me underestimating how steep the initial learning 
            curve of CSS would be, since  the sheer number of concepts and options can 
            be overwhelming. 
             Even as I am creating the web pages for this final assessment,
            I am having the most difficulty with the CSS part of the page design.
            <br>I felt like I struggled with the course load in my second semester 
            of the Seneca Computer Programming and Analysis program, particularly 
            during the C++ focused Object-Oriented Programming course and the Web 
            Development course. In addition, it was a challenging experience to learn how 
            to handle school, work and personal life, and I strugged with time management 
            during the semester. 
            I hope to do better in the future using what 
            I learned this semester.
